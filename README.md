# django-on-a-platter

Example repo to spike using a branchable Platter Postgres database (<https://platter.dev>) to back a
Django application.

## Setup for development

This repo is a spike, e.g. it commits it's production secret to GitHub, so don't deploy it directly
ðŸ˜…. All the branching functionality hacked into this repo will be nicely wrapped up in `platter` and
its generated code in the future.

- Install `pipenv`
- Install deps with `pipenv install`
- Install `platter` somewhere on your PATH, ensuring you have an account from
  <https://dashboard.platter.dev/register>
- Log in to your Platter account: `platter identity login`
- Launch a project-specific shell: `pipenv shell`

### Troubleshooting dev setup

- psychopg2 will not install cleanly: this can be a finicky package. On Mac, for instance, you may
  have to explicitly install and/or add openssl libs to the library path, e.g.:

    ```bash
    brew install openssl
    LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/ pipenv install psycopg2
    ```

## Develop

- Run `./platter_watch`, which will track the current git branch and configure the Django app to use
  the appropriate Platter database branch (read more about Platter resource branching
  [here](https://docs.platter.dev/concepts/branching)).
- In another terminal/tab, run the Django app: `python manage.py runserver`
